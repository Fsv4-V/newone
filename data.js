// ── ABSTRACT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
const ABSTRACT = `
Chronic diabetic wounds affect hundreds of millions of people globally, and wound pH is one of the most reliable
early biomarkers of infection and healing status. This Final Year Project develops a coin-sized, hand-fabricated
flexible wound monitoring patch built around a Polyaniline (PANI) potentiometric pH electrode paired with an
Ag/AgCl reference electrode on a low-cost PET substrate. The work has progressed through five documented weeks of
structured research — from defining the clinical problem and studying wound pH variation, through clinical
pathology and similar-product analysis, to component/datasheet gathering, electronics "brain" design, and flexible
PCB fabrication costing. Every weekly folder of collected resources is preserved as evidence, and each technical
decision is traceable to a specific comparison or reference. The project is intentionally scoped to be reproducible
within a Sri Lankan university laboratory at a prototype cost of roughly LKR 15,000–20,000.
