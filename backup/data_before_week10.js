// ── ABSTRACT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
const ABSTRACT = `
Chronic diabetic wounds affect hundreds of millions of people globally, and wound pH is one of the most reliable
early biomarkers of infection and healing status. This Final Year Project develops a coin-sized, hand-fabricated
flexible wound monitoring patch built around a Polyaniline (PANI) potentiometric pH electrode paired with an
Ag/AgCl reference electrode on a low-cost PET substrate. The work has progressed through five documented weeks of
structured research — from defining the clinical problem and studying wound pH variation, through clinical
pathology and similar-product analysis, to component/datasheet gathering, electronics "brain" design, and flexible
PCB fabrication costing. Every weekly folder of collected resources is preserved as evidence, and each technical
decision is traceable to a specific comparison or reference. The project is intentionally scoped to be reproducible
within a Sri Lankan university laboratory at a prototype cost of roughly LKR 15,000–20,000.

    "summary": "Week 01 established the foundation of the Final Year Project by identifying diabetic wound monitoring as a clinically important and engineering-relevant problem. The main focus was to understand why chronic diabetic wounds require continuous monitoring and why wound pH can be used as an early biomarker for healing status, infection risk and chronic wound progression. During this week, pH variation in normal skin, healing wounds, chronic wounds and infected wounds was studied. Different possible sensing methods were compared, including optical pH sensing, electrochemical pH sensing, ISFET-based sensors and wearable smart dressing approaches. This week helped convert the broad idea of wound monitoring into a focused project direction based on flexible pH sensing integrated into a smart wound dressing.",
    "goals": "The main goal of Week 01 was to define the clinical problem, understand the importance of wound pH, compare possible sensing technologies and select a realistic project direction suitable for a final-year engineering project. The week also aimed to identify the gap between ordinary wound inspection and continuous electronic wound monitoring.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "Wound pH is a valuable biomarker because healthy and healing wounds are usually slightly acidic, while chronic or infected wounds often shift toward alkaline pH.",
      "Diabetic wounds require regular monitoring because infection or delayed healing may occur before clear visual symptoms appear.",
      "Conventional wound assessment depends heavily on manual observation during dressing changes, which does not provide continuous information.",
      "Commercial wound monitoring systems and advanced medical sensors are often expensive and not easily accessible in low-resource clinical environments.",
      "Flexible smart dressing technology is more suitable than rigid sensing probes because it can follow skin curvature and remain close to the wound region.",
      "pH sensing was selected as the primary measurable parameter because it has strong clinical relevance and can be implemented using low-cost electrochemical methods."
    ],
    "decisions": "The project direction was narrowed to a smart diabetic wound monitoring patch with wound pH as the primary sensing parameter. A dressing-integrated wearable approach was selected instead of a handheld or laboratory-only measurement system. The project also began focusing on low-cost, locally feasible fabrication methods rather than expensive cleanroom-based devices.",
    "rejected": "A purely visual wound assessment method was rejected because it cannot detect hidden biochemical changes. A laboratory-only pH meter approach was also rejected because it is not suitable for continuous or wearable monitoring. High-cost commercial pH sensing modules were not selected as the main direction because they do not match the low-cost FYP target.",
    "nextWeek": "The next week moved toward clinical background research, wound healing pathology, wearable sensor examples and similar product analysis to strengthen the biomedical and engineering justification of the project.",

The work focused on understanding wound healing stages, inflammation, infection, tissue repair and chronic wound behavior using pathology references. This helped clarify why diabetic wounds are difficult to heal and why continuous monitoring can support early intervention. In parallel, wearable sensor technologies and flexible circuit printing methods were studied to understand how electronic sensors can be integrated into a wound dressing. Similar products such as SmartHEAL and other wearable wound-monitoring concepts were reviewed as practical benchmarks. This week was important because it confirmed that the project should not be only an electronics device, but a biomedical wearable system designed around clinical needs.",

    "keyFindings": [
      "Wound healing involves inflammation, tissue formation and remodeling stages, and diabetic wounds can become delayed or chronic due to poor circulation, infection and impaired cellular response.",

      "Many existing solutions focus on RFID, optical sensing or single-parameter monitoring, leaving space for a low-cost multi-parameter active electronic patch.",
      "A wearable patch should minimize disturbance to the wound and avoid frequent dressing removal."

    "decisions": "The project continued with a flexible wearable patch concept rather than a rigid external device. A biomedical design direction was selected: the sensor layer should be disposable or wound-contact-safe, while the electronics module should be reusable where possible. Similar-product research was used to position the project as a low-cost, active monitoring alternative.",
    "rejected": "Rigid sensor assemblies were rejected because they may be uncomfortable and unsuitable for wound dressing integration. A purely RFID-based passive system was not selected as the main direction because the project requires active multi-parameter sensing, signal processing and potential BLE/Wi-Fi communication.",

    "summary": "Week 07 moved the project from literature-based concept development to an implementable engineering prototype plan. The system was divided into a low-cost disposable sensing patch (Stage A) and a reusable data-acquisition module (Stage B). A six-layer prototype stack was defined using a PET substrate, printed conductive traces, carbon sensing structures, a PANI pH-active layer, an Ag/AgCl reference concept and PU-film passivation. Separate acquisition paths were defined for potentiometric pH, digital temperature and AC-impedance-based moisture sensing. The patch-to-module interface, noise-control rules, safety restrictions and benchtop validation workflow were also established. All work remains at the engineering prototype-planning stage, with laboratory validation, biocompatibility and clinical approval still pending.",
    "goals": "Convert the research findings into a practical fabrication and electronics plan; define the disposable and reusable system stages; select accessible materials and facilities; specify the pH, temperature and moisture signal requirements; correct unsuitable hardware assumptions; define the patch connector; and prepare a measurable laboratory-validation sequence for Week 08.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "A two-stage architecture is the most practical solution: a disposable wound-contact sensing patch and a reusable low-power DAQ and wireless module.",
      "A six-layer low-cost bench-prototype stack was defined using PET, printed conductive traces, carbon structures, a PANI active layer, an Ag/AgCl reference concept and PU-film encapsulation.",
      "The PANI pH channel is a very-high-impedance potentiometric source and requires separate buffering of both the working and reference electrodes before differential ADC measurement.",
      "The temperature channel uses four TMP117 digital sensors and requires I2C address management through a bus switch or separate buses.",
      "The moisture channel must use low-energy, zero-mean AC or biphasic excitation rather than continuous DC to reduce polarization, corrosion and drift.",
      "A critical correction was made after confirming that the ESP32-C3 has no true voltage-output DAC; PWM or complementary GPIO excitation with attenuation, AC coupling and current limiting was selected instead.",
      "A keyed 12-pin patch interface was defined with separation between high-impedance pH lines, digital/PWM traces, power, guard and identification connections.",
      "A complete validation workflow was prepared for electrical integrity, PANI film quality, pH calibration, temperature calibration, moisture characterization, cross-talk, mechanical bending and safety review."
    ],
    "decisions": "Proceed with the Stage A disposable sensing patch and Stage B reusable electronics architecture. Use the six-layer PET/printed-trace/carbon/PANI/Ag-AgCl/PU stack for non-clinical prototype development. Keep pH, temperature and moisture on separate acquisition paths matched to their signal physics. Use current-limited zero-mean excitation for moisture sensing, buffer the pH electrodes before the ADC, manage the TMP117 and ADS1115 I2C addressing, and use a keyed 12-pin interface with strain relief and signal separation.",
    "rejected": "The ESP32-C3 internal-DAC assumption was rejected because the device has no true voltage-output DAC. Continuous DC excitation across wet electrodes, direct connection of the high-impedance PANI electrode to the ADC, treating the Ag/AgCl reference as circuit ground, placing all sensors on one undifferentiated acquisition path, claiming a confirmed sub-USD-50 complete prototype cost and describing bench materials as wound-safe were also rejected.",
    "nextWeek": "Freeze the sensor geometry and connector-tail artwork, confirm laboratory access and chemical-safety procedures, obtain complete supplier quotations, assemble and verify the reusable DAQ on breakout boards, fabricate initial trace and carbon coupons, synthesize or obtain PANI, and begin controlled pH and moisture calibration using buffer solutions and wound simulants.",
    "evidence": "Week 07 evidence includes the full engineering progress report, two integrated summary graphics, four separate technical infographics, the six-layer patch stack, sensor signal matrix, pH and moisture acquisition-chain concepts, 12-pin interface definition, validation plan, risk register and supervisor decision list. Laboratory validation is still pending."

    "summary": "Week 08 established the project’s evidence and data-analysis foundation. Eleven wound-monitoring papers were indexed, 53 figures were systematically screened, and the most useful numerical evidence was organised into traceable raw, cleaned and feature-level datasets. Five published tables produced 56 raw rows, which were transformed into 38 tidy time-series rows and eight curve-level samples. A 28-column feature table was prepared, with 15 numerical features used for exploratory PCA, t-SNE and MDS visualisation. In parallel, the Ceylon Medical Journal manuscript was revised through three controlled versions and strengthened with quantitative pH, temperature and moisture interpretation. This week did not include new patient measurements, prototype sensor measurements or a validated clinical machine-learning model; all numerical results remain literature-derived method-development evidence.",
    "goals": "Build a reproducible literature-to-data pipeline; classify and prioritise published figures before extraction; create traceable raw, cleaned and feature datasets; test whether trajectory features can be represented using exploratory dimensionality reduction; correct and strengthen the CMJ structured narrative review; and prepare a supervisor-ready report that clearly separates published evidence from future experimental sensor data.",
    "keyFindings": [
      "Eleven papers were indexed with topic, parameter, wound type, sensor type, source link, priority and scientific notes.",
      "Fifty-three figures were triaged before digitisation: 25 selected, 7 optional and 21 excluded because they were unsuitable for numerical time-series extraction.",
      "Five clear published tables produced 56 raw rows, 38 cleaned time-series rows and eight curve-level samples covering wound area, healing percentage, granulation tissue and temperature.",
      "A 28-column feature table was created, with 15 numerical descriptors representing curve structure, starting and ending state, variability, total change, slope, area under the curve and timing.",
      "PCA was completed with PC1 explaining about 50.5% and PC2 about 40.3%, giving approximately 90.8% combined variance for the current eight-sample feature set.",
      "t-SNE and MDS were generated only for exploratory visualisation; the current sample size is too small for reliable clustering, supervised prediction or clinical diagnostic claims.",
      "True UMAP was not treated as complete because one package used a spectral-embedding fallback; a reproducible UMAP run is planned after the dataset is expanded.",
      "The CMJ manuscript progressed through V1, V2 and V3, with the final Week 08 version framed as a structured narrative review containing 21 key references and quantitative biomarker interpretation.",
      "The most defensible clinical principle is to interpret trends and agreement between pH, temperature and moisture rather than relying on one isolated sensor reading.",
      "The literature-derived dataset and future prototype or clinical measurements must remain separated and independently validated."
    ],
    "decisions": "Use the literature-derived files as a preliminary method-development and analysis-demonstration dataset rather than as a clinical training cohort. Preserve separate raw, cleaned and feature layers with stable sample IDs and source traceability. Use PCA as the first explanatory dimensionality-reduction method and treat t-SNE, MDS and future UMAP only as exploratory views. Expand the dataset before formal model comparison, separate calibration, healing-trajectory and wound-status tasks, and keep the CMJ paper as a structured narrative review without unpublished clinical claims.",
    "rejected": "Claims of infection-detection accuracy, patient-outcome prediction or validated machine-learning performance were rejected because the current feature table contains only eight heterogeneous literature-derived curves. Combining wound area, healing percentage, granulation and temperature into one unqualified prediction target was rejected. Treating the spectral-embedding fallback as true UMAP, reporting demonstration model errors as final performance, describing published data as project-collected clinical data and adding unsupported PRISMA counts were also rejected.",
    "nextWeek": "Digitise the highest-priority pH and temperature curves, assign new sample IDs from S009 onward, preserve raw WebPlotDigitizer exports, add parameter-specific features, increase the feature table toward an immediate 30–50-curve milestone, rerun PCA, t-SNE, true UMAP and MDS from one version-controlled script, finalise the CMJ author and submission details, and connect the evidence findings to the next hardware and sensor-design decisions.",
    "evidence": "Week 08 evidence includes the full progress report, six portfolio graphics, an 11-paper index, a 53-figure extraction plan, a rename map, 56 raw literature-derived data rows, 38 cleaned time-series rows, an eight-sample feature table, PCA/t-SNE/MDS outputs, manuscript versions V1–V3, the adviser-response document and the submission checklist. No new patient or prototype sensor data were collected during this week."

      "summary": "Week 09 expanded the project evidence base and translated clinical wound-monitoring literature into measurable engineering requirements. Seventy-five readable PDF copies were reviewed, representing 70 unique documents after duplicate-content checking. The strongest evidence supported pH as the primary healing/chronicity biomarker, temperature as a complementary indicator of inflammation and perfusion, and moisture/exudate as a relative dressing-state variable. The literature was converted into a four-location spatial sensing concept covering the wound centre, two wound-edge positions and a peri-wound reference. A modular architecture was also refined: a disposable sensing patch, a reusable analog/embedded/BLE acquisition module and a phone or laptop interface for clinician-reviewed trend interpretation. Week 09 was literature-driven and concept-development focused; it did not include patient data collection, completed plaster fabrication, sensor calibration or a validated diagnostic algorithm.",
      "goals": "Expand and screen the chronic-wound evidence base; extract clinically and technically relevant pH, temperature, moisture and infection findings; translate the evidence into sensor ranges, spatial measurement locations, signal-conditioning requirements and system architecture; define trend-based multimodal interpretation logic; and prepare a clear supervisor-ready plan for beginning non-clinical hardware validation in Week 10.",
      "keyFindings": [
          "The archive contained 75 valid PDF copies and 70 unique documents after duplicate checking, including 13 focused smart-wound engineering papers, 21 foundational or clinical papers, seven dataset-oriented studies and a screened 34-paper dermatology issue collection.",
          "Wound pH was the strongest biomarker in the reviewed evidence: healing commonly corresponded to decreasing acidity/alkalinity trends, while chronic or non-healing wounds tended to remain more alkaline.",
          "Temperature is useful as a complementary parameter for inflammation, infection risk, perfusion and healing status, but spatial differences and time trends are more informative than one absolute reading.",
          "Moisture and exudate should initially be reported as relative states such as dry, controlled, high or saturated because the literature does not support one universal clinical moisture threshold.",
          "No single biomarker should be interpreted independently; the proposed decision logic uses signal quality, time trajectory, centre-to-edge difference and multimodal agreement before clinician review.",
          "The evidence supports four sensing locations: wound centre, left wound edge, right wound edge and peri-wound or surrounding skin as a reference region.",
          "A pH span of approximately 4–10, a high-priority wound range of 6–9 and temperature coverage of approximately 25–45 °C were selected as laboratory design targets rather than validated diagnostic thresholds.",
          "The system architecture separates a disposable wound-contact patch from reusable high-input-impedance signal conditioning, ADC, microcontroller, BLE, battery management and local data storage.",
          "The literature-to-engineering workflow now provides a clear path from biomarker evidence through sensor selection, patch geometry, electronics specification and non-clinical validation planning.",
          "The Week 09 archive contained no completed practical plaster files, clinical measurements, calibration curves or validated infection-classification model."
      ],
      "decisions": "Use pH as the primary wound-state parameter, temperature as a complementary spatial and temporal parameter, and moisture as an optional relative-state channel. Continue with a four-region centre/edge/peri-wound layout and the disposable-patch/reusable-module architecture. Record raw and calibrated values separately, use BLE for phone or laptop transfer, retain local timestamped storage and interpret results using trends and multimodal agreement under clinician review rather than autonomous diagnosis.",
      "rejected": "A one-point sensing layout, isolated threshold interpretation, universal pH or temperature cut-offs, direct claims of infection diagnosis, treating literature values as a harmonised clinical dataset, reporting moisture as an absolute percentage without traceable calibration, and presenting Week 09 as prototype or patient validation were rejected. Complex hyperspectral, multiplexed biochemical and closed-loop treatment systems were retained only as future references because they exceed the first-prototype scope.",
      "nextWeek": "Freeze the first-prototype requirements and obtain supervisor approval; fabricate and condition the PANI working electrode and Ag/AgCl reference; run repeated pH 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10 calibration cycles; calibrate each temperature channel from approximately 25–45 °C; assess the optional moisture channel from dry to saturated conditions; prepare a non-clinical four-segment patch mock-up; implement timestamped raw-data logging and BLE transfer; and run a controlled integration test using buffer solutions, saline or synthetic wound fluid.",
      "evidence": "Week 09 evidence includes the full supervisor-ready progress report and four unique portfolio infographics. The literature audit recorded 75 readable PDF copies and 70 unique documents, together with biomarker evidence tables, quantitative design targets, a four-location spatial sensing concept, disposable/reusable architecture, research-stage decision logic, engineering risk register, supervisor decision requests and an eight-step Week 10 validation plan. One additional uploaded infographic was an exact duplicate and was retained as source evidence but not repeated in the website gallery."
